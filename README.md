This repository houses all of 5 tasks I have worked on during an NLP course. The structure is as follows:
[task_folder]
    [code]
    [report]
    [task]
Sentiment analysis consists of 2 tasks named '0' and '1'.
All of datasets are mentioned in reports and tasks, however, they have not been uploaded into the repository due to size.
